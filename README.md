# Blackjack-Fancy
A Blackjack program for my IT261 Final

Program: Blackjack

Language: Python 3.11.5

Description: Plays a game of Blackjack (vs Computer) and maintains files (discard and shoe (as text files)) and reads, appends, and writes to it at varying times. User draws two cards, can only hit and stand, and whoever wins, gets the difference of score in points. When the total score is reached (set by user), the user can elect to play again and if so, cleans the discard, resets the shoe and the game starts again.
